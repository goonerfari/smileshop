        <h3>CORE RETURN POLICY</h3>

        <p>Starting on 08/01/13, compressor/dryer customers are required to pay an up front $25 core charge at the time of purchase -AND- are required to pay for return shipping of the old compressor & dryer.</p>

        <p>The ONLY way to purchase a compressor/dryer without paying the core charge, is if the core is sent in BEFORE the purchase is made. Only then, is the core fee not required at time of purchase.</p>

        <p>This $25 core charge will be refunded upon return of the compressor & dryer, but only if BOTH the compressor & dryer are returned and are returned within 30 days of purchase.</p>

        <h3>COMPRESSOR/DRYER WARRANTY POLICY</h3>

        <p>All rebuilt compressors, are warranted for 2 full years from the day of purchase, as long as the original old compressor/dryer core was returned within 30 days of purchase and upon inspection we find no signs of moisture inside the compressor and/or signs of overheating (driving vehicle with a leak). All warranties are for the original purchaser and are nontransferable. Warranty is for part replacement only and DOES NOT include labor.</p>

        <p>Any compressor that is being submitted for a warranty claim will need to be shipped at the customers expense to the 311 Dry Fork Rd., Del Rio,TN. location and inspected by Smile Herb before any warranty action is taken by Smile Herb.</p>

        <h3>EXPEDITION & NAVIGATOR CUSTOMERS:</h3>

        <p>PLEASE DO NOT SEND "U MOUNTING BRACKET" with your old compressor/dryer! These are usually discarded and we cannot guarantee you'll get yours back!</p>

        <h3>CONVERSION KIT WARRANTY POLICY</h3>
        <p>ALL of our Smile Herb Kits, for the exception of our "Economy" line kit, have a Lifetime Warranty! All warranties are for the original purchaser and are nontransferable. Warranty is for part replacement only and DOES NOT include labor. While the coil springs, mounts & such are covered for life, the struts and/or shocks are not(don't be fooled by the lies of other companies), as they are a wear item and just like tires, brakes, clutches, etc., they will need to be replaced in time. Replacement shocks/struts can be purchased separately from Smile Herb later on if the need arises.</p>
